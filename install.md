## Install packaged versions of CRI-O

CRI-O follows the [Kubernetes support cycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions)
of three minor releases. CRI-O also attempts to package generically for Debian
(deb) and Red Hat (RPM) based distributions and package managers.

If there's a version or operating system that is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/new).

For more information, please follow the instructions in the [CRI-O packaging repository](https://github.com/cri-o/packaging/blob/main/README.md).

## Install CRI-O on Flatcar with Sysexts

Installing CRI-O on Flatcar Container Linux with support for systemd extensions (sysexts),
enabling a supported installation method for environments that utilize Flatcar.

### Prerequisites

- Flatcar Container Linux installed on your machine. [(Flatcar Installation guide)](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/)
- Systemd extensions (sysexts) enabled on Flatcar Container Linux.
  [(Enable Sysext in Flatcar)](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/provisioning/sysext/)
- `curl` or `wget` for downloading files.
- `tar` for extracting the CRI-O binaries.
- `sed` for editing files in-place.
- Sufficient privileges (using sudo if necessary).

Please make sure you have Flatcar Container Linux installed and sysexts enabled before
proceeding with the installation of CRI-O.

### Installation Steps

To install CRI-O on Flatcar Container Linux with sysexts, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Download the installation script:

  Sample extension script for installing CRI-O using sysext is [here](https://github.com/flatcar/sysext-bakery/blob/main/create_crio_sysext.sh).
  - Using curl:

    ```bash
    curl -L \
    https://github.com/flatcar/sysext-bakery/blob/main/create_crio_sysext.sh \
    -o create_crio_sysext.sh
    ```

  - Using wget:

    ```bash
    wget \
    https://github.com/flatcar/sysext-bakery/blob/main/create_crio_sysext.sh \
    -O create_crio_sysext.sh
    ```

Make the script executable.

```bash
chmod +x create_crio_sysext.sh
```

- Step 2: Run the installation script:

  Execute the script with the required arguments:
  - The version of CRI-O you wish to install. [(Find a specific version of
    CRI-O here)](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/releases)
  - The name you wish to give to the sysext image.
  - Optionally, set the `ARCH` environment variable if you need a specific architecture.

  ```bash
  ./create_crio_sysext.sh VERSION SYSEXTNAME
  ```

  Example:

  ```bash
  ./create_crio_sysext.sh 1.28.4 crio-sysext
  ```

- Step 3: Deploy the system extension:
  - Once the script completes, you will have a `.raw` sysext image file named as
    per your `SYSEXTNAME` argument.
  - To deploy the system extension, move the `.raw` file to the
    `/var/lib/extensions` directory on your Flatcar Container Linux system and
    enable it with the `systemctl` command.

  ```bash
  sudo mv SYSEXTNAME.raw /var/lib/extensions/
  sudo systemctl enable extensions-SYSEXTNAME.slice
  sudo systemctl start extensions-SYSEXTNAME.slice
  ```

- Step 4: Verify the installation:
  - Verify that the CRI-O service is running correctly.

    ```bash
    systemctl status crio
    ```

  - Ensure that the CRI-O binaries are correctly placed and that the system
    recognizes the new systemd sysext image.

### Additional Notes

- The script will create a temporary directory for its operations, which
  will be cleaned up after the sysext image is created.

- All files within the sysext image will be owned by root.The guide assumes
  the default architecture is `x86-64`. For ARM64 systems, pass `ARCH=arm64`
  as an environment variable when running the script.

## Build and install CRI-O from source

### Runtime dependencies

- runc, crun or any other OCI compatible runtime
- iproute
- iptables

Latest version of `runc` is expected to be installed on the system. It is picked
up as the default runtime by CRI-O.

### Build and Run Dependencies

#### Fedora - RHEL 7 - CentOS

##### Required

Fedora, RHEL 7, CentOS and related distributions:

```shell
yum install -y \
  containers-common \
  git \
  glib2-devel \
  glibc-devel \
  glibc-static \
  go \
  gpgme-devel \
  libassuan-devel \
  libgpg-error-devel \
  libseccomp-devel \
  libselinux-devel \
  pkgconfig \
  make \
  runc
```

**Please note**:

- `CentOS 8` (or higher): `pkgconfig` package is replaced by `pkgconf-pkg-config`
- By default btrfs is not enabled. To add the btrfs support, install the
  following package: `btrfs-progs-devel`
- `CentOS 8`: `gpgme-devel` can be
  installed with the powertools repo.
  (`yum install -y gpgme-devel --enablerepo=powertools`)
- `CentOS 9`: `gpgme-devel` can be
  installed with the CodeReadyBuilder (crb) repo.
  (`yum install -y gpgme-devel --enablerepo=crb`)
- It is possible the distribution packaged version of runc is out of date.
- If you'd like to get the latest and greatest runc, consider using
  the one found in [devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable)

#### RHEL 8

For RHEL 8 distributions (tested on RHEL 8.5).

Make sure you are subscribed to the following repositories:

- BaseOS/x86_64
- Appstream/x86_64
- CodeReady Linux Builder for x86_64

```shell
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
```

Follow [this guide to subscribe to the repositories](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/265523)
if not already subscribed.

This requires Go version 1.18 or greater. Follow [these instructions to install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Install dependencies:

```shell
yum install -y \
  containers-common \
  git \
  make \
  glib2-devel \
  glibc-devel \
  glibc-static \
  runc
```

Install go-md2man:

  libseccomp-devel \
  libselinux \
  pkgconf-pkg-config \
  gpgme-devel \
  gcc-go
```

#### Debian - Raspbian - Ubuntu

On Debian, Raspbian and Ubuntu distributions, [enable the Kubic project
repositories](#apt-based-operating-systems) (for `containers-common`
and `cri-o-runc` packages) and install the following packages:

##### Debian up to buster - Raspbian - Ubuntu up to 18.04

```shell
apt update -qq && \
# For Debian 10(buster) or below: use "apt install -t buster-backports"
apt install -y  \
  btrfs-tools \
  containers-common \
  git \
  libassuan-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libc6-dev \

  pkg-config \
  go-md2man \
  cri-o-runc \
  libudev-dev \
  software-properties-common \
  gcc \
  make
```

##### Debian bullseye or higher - Ubuntu 20.04 or higher

```shell
apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y \
  libbtrfs-dev \
  containers-common \
  git \
  libassuan-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \

  go-md2man \
  cri-o-runc \
  libudev-dev \
  software-properties-common \
  gcc \
  make
```

**Caveats and Notes:**

If using an older release or a long-term support release, be careful to
double-check that the version of `runc` is new enough (running `runc --version`
should produce `spec: 1.0.0` or greater), or else build your own.

Be careful to double-check that the version of golang is new enough, version
1.12.x or higher is required. If needed, newer golang versions are available at
[the official download website](https://golang.org/dl).

### Get Source Code

Clone the source code using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o # or your fork
cd cri-o
```

Make sure your `CRI-O` and `kubernetes` versions are of matching major versions.
For instance, if you want to be compatible with the latest kubernetes release,
you'll need to use the latest tagged release of `CRI-O` on branch `release-1.18`.

### Build

To install with default buildtags using seccomp, use:

```shell
make
sudo make install
```

Otherwise, if you do not want to build `CRI-O` with seccomp support you can add
`BUILDTAGS=""` when running make.

```shell
make BUILDTAGS=""
sudo make install
```

#### Install with Ansible

An [Ansible Role](https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-cri_o) is also
available to automate the above steps:

```bash
sudo su -
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/roles
cd ~/.ansible/roles
git clone https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-cri_o.git cri_o
cd ~/.ansible/roles/cri_o
pip3 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --requirement requirements.txt
molecule converge
molecule verify
```

#### Build Tags

`CRI-O` supports optional build tags for compiling support of various features.
To add build tags to the make option the `BUILDTAGS` variable must be set.

```shell
make BUILDTAGS='seccomp apparmor'
```

| Build Tag | Feature                            | Dependency |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| seccomp   | syscall filtering                  | libseccomp |
| selinux   | selinux process and mount labeling | libselinux |
| apparmor  | apparmor profile support           |            |

`CRI-O` manages images with [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image),
which uses the following buildtags.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Build Tag                    | Feature                                     | Dependency |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| containers_image_openpgp     | use native golang pgp instead of cgo        |            |
| containers_image_ostree_stub | disable use of ostree as an image transport |            |

`CRI-O` also uses [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage) for managing container storage.

| Build Tag                   | Feature                             | Dependency |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| exclude_graphdriver_btrfs   | exclude btrfs as a storage option   |            |
| btrfs_noversion             | for building btrfs version < 3.16.1 | btrfs      |
| exclude_graphdriver_overlay | exclude overlay as a storage option |            |
| ostree                      | build storage using ostree          | ostree     |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Static builds

It is possible to build a statically linked binary of CRI-O by using the
officially provided [nix](https://nixos.org/nix) package and the derivation of
it [within this repository](../nix). The builds are completely reproducible and
will create a `x86_64`/`amd64` or `aarch64`/`arm64`, `ppc64le` or `s390x`
stripped ELF binary for [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc) or [musl
libc (for `s390x`)](https://www.musl-libc.org/). These binaries are integration tested
(for `amd64` and `arm64`) as well and support the following features:

- apparmor
- btrfs
- gpgme
- seccomp
- selinux

To build the binaries locally either [install the nix package
manager](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) or use the `make build-static`
target which relies on the nixos/nix container image.

The overall build process can take a tremendous amount of CPU time depending on
the hardware. The resulting binaries should now be available within:

- `bin/static/crio`

To build the binaries without any prepared container and via the already
installed nix package manager, simply run the following command from the root
directory of this repository:

```shell
nix build -f nix
```

The resulting binaries should be now available in `result/bin`. To build the arm
variant of the binaries, just run:

```shell
nix build -f nix/default-arm64.nix
```

Similarly, the ppc64le variant of binaries can be built using:

```shell
nix build -f nix/default-ppc64le.nix
```

In the same way, the s390x variant of binaries can be built using:

```shell
nix build -f nix/default-s390x.nix
```

### Download conmon

[conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a per-container daemon that
`CRI-O` uses to monitor container logs and exit information.
`conmon` needs to be downloaded with `CRI-O`.

running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/containers/conmon
cd conmon
make
sudo make install
```

will download conmon to your $PATH.

## Setup CNI networking

A proper description of setting up CNI networking is given in the
[`contrib/cni` README](/contrib/cni/README.md). But the gist is that you need to
have some basic network configurations enabled and CNI plugins installed on
your system.

## CRI-O configuration

If you are installing for the first time, generate and install
configuration files with:

```shell
sudo make install.config
```

### Validate registries in registries.conf

Edit `/etc/containers/registries.conf` and verify that the registries option has
valid values in it. For example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```conf
[registries.search]
registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'registry.fedoraproject.org', 'quay.io', 'docker.io']

[registries.insecure]
registries = []

[registries.block]
registries = []
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

For more information about this file see [registries.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md).

### Optional - Modify verbosity of logs

Users can modify the `log_level` by specifying an overwrite like
`/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-log-level.conf` to change the verbosity of
the logs. Options are fatal, panic, error, warn, info (default), debug and
trace.

```conf
[crio.runtime]
log_level = "info"
```

### Optional - Modify capabilities and sysctls

By default, `CRI-O` uses the following capabilities:

```conf
default_capabilities = [
  "CHOWN",
  "DAC_OVERRIDE",
  "FSETID",
  "FOWNER",
  "SETGID",
  "SETUID",
  "SETPCAP",
  "NET_BIND_SERVICE",
  "KILL",
]
```

and no sysctls

```conf
default_sysctls = [
]
```

Users can change either default by adding overwrites to `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d`.

## Starting CRI-O

Running make install will download CRI-O into the folder

```shell
/usr/local/bin/crio
```

You can run it manually there, or you can set up a systemd unit file with:

```shell
sudo make install.systemd
```

And let systemd take care of running CRI-O:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable crio
sudo systemctl start crio
```

## Using CRI-O

- Follow this [tutorial](tutorials/crictl.md) to quickly get started running
  simple pods and containers.
- To run a full cluster, see [the instructions](tutorials/kubernetes.md).
- To run with kubeadm, see [kubeadm instructions](tutorials/kubeadm.md).
