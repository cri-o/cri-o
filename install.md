## Install packaged versions of CRI-O

CRI-O builds for native package managers using [openSUSE's OBS](https://build.opensuse.org)

### Supported versions

CRI-O follows the [Kubernetes support cycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions)
of three minor releases.
CRI-O also attempts to package for the following operating systems:

```text
Fedora 31+
openSUSE
CentOS 9 Stream
CentOS 8
CentOS 8 Stream
CentOS 7
Debian 10
Debian 11
Debian 12
Rasbian 10
Rasbian 11
xUbuntu 22.04
xUbuntu 21.10
xUbuntu 20.04
xUbuntu 18.04
```

To install, choose a supported version for your operating system, and export it
as a variable, like so: `export VERSION=1.19`

We also save releases as subprojects. If you'd, for instance, like to use `1.24.5`
you can set `export VERSION=1.24.5` and
`export SUBVERSION=$(echo $VERSION | awk -F'.' '{print $1"."$2}')`

Packaging for CRI-O is done best-effort, and is largely driven by requests.
If there's a version or operating system that is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/new).

### Installation Instructions

#### openSUSE

```shell
sudo zypper install cri-o
```

#### Fedora 31 or later

```shell
sudo dnf module enable cri-o:$VERSION
sudo dnf install cri-o
```

For Fedora, we only support setting minor versions. i.e: `VERSION=1.18`,
and do not support pinning patch versions: `VERSION=1.18.3`

Note: as of 1.24.0, the `cri-o` package no longer depends on
`containernetworking-plugins` package.
Removing this dependency allows users to install their own CNI plugins without
having to remove files first.
If users want to use the previously provided CNI plugins, they should also run:

```shell
sudo dnf install containernetworking-plugins
```

#### Other yum based operating systems

To install on the following operating systems, set the environment variable ```$OS```
to the appropriate value from the following table:

| Operating system | $OS               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Centos 9 Stream  | `CentOS_9_Stream` |
| Centos 8         | `CentOS_8`        |
| Centos 8 Stream  | `CentOS_8_Stream` |
| Centos 7         | `CentOS_7`        |

And then run the following as root:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```shell
curl -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.repo
curl -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.repo

or if you are using a subproject release:

curl -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:${VERSION}.repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/${SUBVERSION}:/${VERSION}/$OS/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:${SUBVERSION}:${VERSION}.repo

yum install cri-o
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Note: as of 1.24.0, the `cri-o` package no longer depends on
`containernetworking-plugins` package.
Removing this dependency allows users to install their own CNI plugins without
having to remove files first.
If users want to use the previously provided CNI plugins, they should also run:

```shell
yum install containernetworking-plugins
```

#### APT based operating systems

Note: this tutorial assumes you have curl and gnupg installed

To install on the following operating systems, set the environment variable ```$OS```
to the appropriate value from the following table:

| Operating system   | $OS               |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Debian 12          | `Debian_12`       |
| Debian 11          | `Debian_11`       |
| Debian 10          | `Debian_10`       |
| Raspberry Pi OS 11 | `Raspbian_11`     |
| Raspberry Pi OS 10 | `Raspbian_10`     |
| Ubuntu 22.04       | `xUbuntu_22.04`   |
| Ubuntu 21.10       | `xUbuntu_21.10`   |
| Ubuntu 21.04       | `xUbuntu_21.04`   |
| Ubuntu 20.10       | `xUbuntu_20.10`   |
| Ubuntu 20.04       | `xUbuntu_20.04`   |
| Ubuntu 18.04       | `xUbuntu_18.04`   |

If installing cri-o-runc (recommended), you'll need to install libseccomp >= 2.4.1.
**NOTE: This is not available in distros based on Debian 10(buster) or below,
so buster backports will need to be enabled:**

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```shell
echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list
apt update
apt install -y -t buster-backports libseccomp2 || apt update -y -t buster-backports libseccomp2
```

And then run the following as root:

```shell
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/libcontainers-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/libcontainers-crio-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

mkdir -p /usr/share/keyrings
curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/Release.key | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/libcontainers-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/Release.key | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/libcontainers-crio-archive-keyring.gpg

apt-get update
apt-get install cri-o cri-o-runc
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

**Note: We include cri-o-runc because Ubuntu and Debian include their own packaged
version of runc.**
While this version should work with CRI-O, keeping the packaged versions of CRI-O
and runc in sync ensures they work together.
If you'd like to use the distribution's runc, you'll have to add the file:

```toml
[crio.runtime.runtimes.runc]
runtime_path = ""
runtime_type = "oci"
runtime_root = "/run/runc"
```

to `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/`

Note: as of 1.24.0, the `cri-o` package no longer depends on
`containernetworking-plugins` package.
Removing this dependency allows users to install their own CNI plugins without
having to remove files first.
If users want to use the previously provided CNI plugins, they should also run:

```shell
apt-get install containernetworking-plugins
```

## Build and install CRI-O from source

### Runtime dependencies

- runc, Clear Containers runtime, or any other OCI compatible runtime
- iproute
- iptables

Latest version of `runc` is expected to be installed on the system. It is picked
up as the default runtime by CRI-O.

### Build and Run Dependencies

#### Fedora - RHEL 7 - CentOS

##### Required

Fedora, RHEL 7, CentOS and related distributions:

```shell
yum install -y \
  containers-common \
  device-mapper-devel \
  git \
  glib2-devel \
  glibc-devel \
  glibc-static \
  go \
  gpgme-devel \
  libassuan-devel \
  libgpg-error-devel \
  libseccomp-devel \
  libselinux-devel \
  pkgconfig \
  make \
  runc
```

**Please note**:

- `CentOS 8` (or higher): `pkgconfig` package is replaced by `pkgconf-pkg-config`
- By default btrfs is not enabled. To add the btrfs support, install the
  following package: `btrfs-progs-devel`
- It is possible the distribution packaged version of runc is out of date.
- If you'd like to get the latest and greatest runc, consider using
  the one found in [devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable)

#### RHEL 8

For RHEL 8 distributions (tested on RHEL 8.5).

Make sure you are subscribed to the following repositories:

- BaseOS/x86_64
- Appstream/x86_64
- CodeReady Linux Builder for x86_64

```shell
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
```

Follow [this guide to subscribe to the repositories](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/265523)
if not already subscribed.

This requires Go version 1.18 or greater. Follow [these instructions to install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Install dependencies:

```shell
yum install -y \
  containers-common \
  device-mapper-devel \
  git \
  make \
  glib2-devel \
  glibc-devel \
  glibc-static \
  runc
```

Install go-md2man:

```shell
go get github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
yum install -y \
  libassuan \
  libassuan-devel \
  libgpg-error \
  libseccomp \

  gpgme-devel
```

#### Debian - Raspbian - Ubuntu

On Debian, Raspbian and Ubuntu distributions, [enable the Kubic project
repositories](#apt-based-operating-systems) (for `containers-common`
and `cri-o-runc` packages) and install the following packages:

##### Debian up to buster - Raspbian - Ubuntu up to 18.04

```shell
apt update -qq && \
# For Debian 10(buster) or below: use "apt install -t buster-backports"
apt install -y  \
  btrfs-tools \
  containers-common \
  git \
  golang-go \
  libassuan-dev \
  libdevmapper-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libc6-dev \
  libgpgme11-dev \

  pkg-config \
  go-md2man \
  cri-o-runc \
  libudev-dev \
  software-properties-common \
  gcc \
  make
```

##### Debian bullseye or higher - Ubuntu 20.04 or higher

```shell
apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y \
  libbtrfs-dev \
  containers-common \
  git \
  golang-go \
  libassuan-dev \
  libdevmapper-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libc6-dev \
  libgpgme-dev \
  libgpg-error-dev \

  pkg-config \
  go-md2man \
  cri-o-runc \
  libudev-dev \
  software-properties-common \
  gcc \
  make
```

**Caveats and Notes:**

If using an older release or a long-term support release, be careful to
double-check that the version of `runc` is new enough (running `runc --version`
should produce `spec: 1.0.0` or greater), or else build your own.

Be careful to double-check that the version of golang is new enough, version
1.12.x or higher is required. If needed, newer golang versions are available at
[the official download website](https://golang.org/dl).

### Get Source Code

Clone the source code using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o # or your fork
cd cri-o
```

Make sure your `CRI-O` and `kubernetes` versions are of matching major versions.
For instance, if you want to be compatible with the latest kubernetes release,
you'll need to use the latest tagged release of `CRI-O` on branch `release-1.18`.

### Build

To install with default buildtags using seccomp, use:

```shell
make
sudo make install
```

Otherwise, if you do not want to build `CRI-O` with seccomp support you can add
`BUILDTAGS=""` when running make.

```shell
make BUILDTAGS=""
sudo make install
```

#### Install with Ansible

An [Ansible Role](https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-cri_o) is also
available to automate the above steps:

``` bash
sudo su -
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/roles
cd ~/.ansible/roles
git clone https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-cri_o.git cri_o
cd ~/.ansible/roles/cri_o
pip3 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --requirement requirements.txt
molecule converge
molecule verify
```

#### Build Tags

`CRI-O` supports optional build tags for compiling support of various features.
To add build tags to the make option the `BUILDTAGS` variable must be set.

```shell
make BUILDTAGS='seccomp apparmor'
```

| Build Tag | Feature                            | Dependency |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| seccomp   | syscall filtering                  | libseccomp |
| selinux   | selinux process and mount labeling | libselinux |
| apparmor  | apparmor profile support           |            |

`CRI-O` manages images with [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image),
which uses the following buildtags.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Build Tag                    | Feature                                     | Dependency |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| containers_image_openpgp     | use native golang pgp instead of cgo        |            |
| containers_image_ostree_stub | disable use of ostree as an image transport |            |

`CRI-O` also uses [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage) for managing container storage.

| Build Tag                        | Feature                                         | Dependency   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| exclude_graphdriver_btrfs        | exclude btrfs as a storage option               |              |
| btrfs_noversion                  | for building btrfs version < 3.16.1             | btrfs        |
| exclude_graphdriver_devicemapper | exclude devicemapper as a storage option        |              |
| libdm_no_deferred_remove         | don't compile deferred remove with devicemapper | devicemapper |
| exclude_graphdriver_overlay      | exclude overlay as a storage option             |              |
| ostree                           | build storage using ostree                      | ostree       |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Static builds

It is possible to build a statically linked binary of CRI-O by using the
officially provided [nix](https://nixos.org/nix) package and the derivation of
it [within this repository](../nix). The builds are completely reproducible and
will create a `x86_64`/`amd64` or `aarch64`/`arm64` or `ppc64le` stripped ELF
binary for [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc). These binaries are integration
tested as well and support the following features:

- apparmor
- btrfs
- device mapper
- gpgme
- seccomp
- selinux

To build the binaries locally either [install the nix package
manager](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) or use the `make build-static`
target which relies on the nixos/nix container image.

The overall build process can take a tremendous amount of CPU time depending on
the hardware. The resulting binaries should now be available within:

- `bin/static/crio`

To build the binaries without any prepared container and via the already
installed nix package manager, simply run the following command from the root
directory of this repository:

```shell
nix build -f nix
```

The resulting binaries should be now available in `result/bin`. To build the arm
variant of the binaries, just run:

```shell
nix build -f nix/default-arm64.nix
```

Similarly, the ppc64le variant of binaries can be built using:

```shell
nix build -f nix/default-ppc64le.nix
```

#### Creating a release archive

A release bundle consists of all static binaries, the man pages and
configuration files like `00-default.conf`. The `release-bundle` target can be
used to build a new release archive within the current repository:

```shell
make release-bundle
…
Created ./bundle/cri-o.amd64.v1.20.0.tar.gz
```

### Download conmon

[conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a per-container daemon that
`CRI-O` uses to monitor container logs and exit information.
`conmon` needs to be downloaded with `CRI-O`.

running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/containers/conmon
cd conmon
make
sudo make install
```

will download conmon to your $PATH.

### Setup CNI networking

A proper description of setting up CNI networking is given in the
[`contrib/cni` README](/contrib/cni/README.md). But the gist is that you need to
have some basic network configurations enabled and CNI plugins installed on
your system.

### CRI-O configuration

If you are installing for the first time, generate and install
configuration files with:

```shell
sudo make install.config
```

### Validate registries in registries.conf

Edit `/etc/containers/registries.conf` and verify that the registries option has
valid values in it.  For example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```conf
[registries.search]
registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'registry.fedoraproject.org', 'quay.io', 'docker.io']

[registries.insecure]
registries = []

[registries.block]
registries = []
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

For more information about this file see [registries.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md).

#### Optional - Modify verbosity of logs

Users can modify the `log_level` by specifying an overwrite like
`/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-log-level.conf` to change the verbosity of
the logs. Options are fatal, panic, error, warn, info (default), debug and
trace.

```conf
[crio.runtime]
log_level = "info"
```

#### Optional - Modify capabilities and sysctls

By default, `CRI-O` uses the following capabilities:

```conf
default_capabilities = [
  "CHOWN",
  "DAC_OVERRIDE",
  "FSETID",
  "FOWNER",
  "SETGID",
  "SETUID",
  "SETPCAP",
  "NET_BIND_SERVICE",
  "KILL",
]
```

and no sysctls

```conf
default_sysctls = [
]
```

Users can change either default by adding overwrites to `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d`.

### Starting CRI-O

Running make install will download CRI-O into the folder

```shell
/usr/local/bin/crio
```

You can run it manually there, or you can set up a systemd unit file with:

```shell
sudo make install.systemd
```

And let systemd take care of running CRI-O:

``` bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable crio
sudo systemctl start crio
```

### Using CRI-O

- Follow this [tutorial](tutorials/crictl.md) to quickly get started running
  simple pods and containers.
- To run a full cluster, see [the instructions](tutorials/kubernetes.md).
- To run with kubeadm, see [kubeadm instructions](tutorials/kubeadm.md).

### Updating CRI-O

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
### openSUSE

```shell
sudo zypper update
sudo zypper update cri-o
```

### Fedora 31 or later

```shell
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf update cri-o
```

### Other yum based operating systems

```shell
sudo yum update
sudo yum update cri-o
```

### APT based operating systems

If updating to a patch version (for example, ``VERSION=1.8.3``
  ), run

```shell
apt update cri-o cri-o-runc
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD024 -->

Otherwise, be sure that the environment variable ```$OS``` is set to the
appropriate value from the following table for your operating system.
To install on the following operating systems, set the environment variable ```$OS```
to the appropriate value from the following table:

| Operating system | $OS               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Debian Unstable  | `Debian_Unstable` |
| Debian Testing   | `Debian_Testing`  |
| Debian 11        | `Debian_11`       |
| Debian 10        | `Debian_10`       |
| Ubuntu 22.04     | `xUbuntu_22.04`   |
| Ubuntu 21.10     | `xUbuntu_21.10`   |
| Ubuntu 21.04     | `xUbuntu_21.04`   |
| Ubuntu 20.10     | `xUbuntu_20.10`   |
| Ubuntu 20.04     | `xUbuntu_20.04`   |
| Ubuntu 18.04     | `xUbuntu_18.04`   |

To upgrade, choose a supported version for your operating system,
and export it as a variable, like so:
`export VERSION=1.18`, and run the following as root

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```shell
rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -

apt update
apt install cri-o cri-o-runc
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
