# This is the opposite of ``disable_all_rh_repos`` (above).  It's

enable_rh_repos: []

# When neither of the above meet testing requirements, or additional
# local repositories should be added, this specifies them.  Each item
# in the list is a dictionary of arguments to the standard
# ``yum_repository`` Ansible module.  e.g.
#
# yum_repos:
#     - name: "My special Repo"
#       baseurl: "https://my.special.repo.example.com/"
#       gpgcheck: False
#       includepkgs: rocket2moon
#     - name: "Other special repo"
#       baseurl: "https://you.get.the.idea"
