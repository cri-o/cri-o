# Fedora and RHEL Test execution

This directory contains playbooks to set up and run, all the CRI-O CI tests
for both RHEL and Fedora hosts. Two entry-point playbooks exist:

 - `main.yml`: sets up the machine and runs tests.
 - `results.yml`: gathers test output to `/tmp/artifacts`.

When running the `main.yml` playbook, multiple tags are present:

 - `setup`: Run all tasks to set up the system for testing.
 - `e2e`: Build CRI-O from source and run Kubernetes end-to-end tests.
 - `node-e2e`: Build CRI-O from source and run Kubernetes 'node' end-to-end tests.
 - `integration`: Build CRI-O from source and run the local integration suite twice.
                  First normally, then again with user-namespace support enabled.

The playbooks assume the following things about your system:

 - On RHEL, the repositories for EPEL, rhel-server, and extras repos are configured and functional.
 - The system has been rebooted after installing/updating low-level packages, to ensure they're active.
 - Ansible is installed, and functional with access to the 'root' user.
 - The `$GOPATH` is set and present for all shells (*e.g.* written in `/etc/environment`).
 - The CRI-O repository is present in the desired state at `${GOPATH}/src/github.com/cri-o/cri-o`.
