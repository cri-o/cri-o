 Package vmconf defines an interface for converting particular CNI invocation
 results to networking configuration usable by a VM. It expects the CNI result
 to have the following properties:
 * The results should contain an interface for a tap device, which will be used
   as the VM's tap device.
 * The results should contain an interface with the same name as the tap device
   but with sandbox ID set to the containerID provided during CNI invocation.
   This should be a "pseudo-interface", not one that has actually been created.
   It represents the configuration that should be applied to the VM internally.
   The CNI "containerID" is, in this case, used more as a "vmID" to represent
   the VM's internal network interface.
     * If the CNI results specify an IP associated with this interface, that IP
       should be used to statically configure the VM's internal network interface.

// Due to the limitation of "ip=", not all configuration specified in StaticNetworkConf can be
// applied automatically. In particular:
// * The MacAddr and MTU cannot be applied
// * The only routes created will match what's specified in VMIPConfig; VMRoutes will be ignored.
// * Only up to two namesevers can be supplied. If VMNameservers is has more than 2 entries, only
//   the first two in the slice will be applied in the VM.
// * VMDomain, VMSearchDomains and VMResolverOptions will be ignored
// * Nameserver settings are also only set in /proc/net/pnp. Most applications will thus require
//   /etc/resolv.conf to be a symlink to /proc/net/pnp in order to resolve names as expected.
