# Bors-ng is a service which provides a merge and review bot for github PRs.
# When approved for merging (`bors r+`) or test merging (`bors try`), all
# pending PRs at the time will be merged together in one of two special
# branches. Either 'staging' or 'trying'.  In the case of `staging` branch,
# when all status tests pass (see below) the serialized set of merges will become
# the new destination branch HEAD (i.e. master).  This guarantees there is never
# any conflicts with PR merge order on the destination branch(es).
#
# Note: The branches 'staging.tmp' and 'trying.tmp' must always be ignored
# by _all_ CI systems.  They are by bors temporarily, and may go away at
# unpredictable times.

# status
# ------------------
# Selects which tests are required for merging, matching against values
# from BOTH the older github 'status API' (ref: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses
# /#list-statuses-for-a-specific-ref) AND newer 'checks API'. Ref: https://developer.github.com/v3/checks
# /runs/#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite both return JSON:
#
# Status API:  Matches against '[].context' values
# Checks API:  Matches against 'check_runs[].name' values
#
# Note: The wild-card character '%' is available.
status = [
    "cirrus-ci/success",

# Same as 'status' (above) but statuses that must pass on every PR
pr_status = [
    "cirrus-ci/success",

# Cirrus-CI Max Timeout is 60 * 60 * 2

# List of strings: PR Labels that must NOT be present

# The number of required GitHub code reviews set 'Approve'
# before 'bors r+' will allow merging.  Does not require
