// ImageTransport is a top-level namespace for ways to to store/load an image.
// It should generally correspond to ImageSource/ImageDestination implementations.
//
// Note that ImageTransport is based on "ways the users refer to image storage", not necessarily on the underlying physical transport.
// For example, all Docker References would be used within a single "docker" transport, regardless of whether the images are pulled over HTTP or HTTPS
// (or, even, IPv4 or IPv6).
//
// OTOH all images using the same transport should (apart from versions of the image format), be interoperable.
// For example, several different ImageTransport implementations may be based on local filesystem paths,
// but using completely different formats for the contents of that path (a single tar file, a directory containing tarballs, a fully expanded container filesystem, ...)
//
// See also transports.KnownTransports.

// ImageReference is an abstracted way to refer to an image location, namespaced within an ImageTransport.

// The object should preferably be immutable after creation, with any parsing/state-dependent resolving happening
// within an ImageTransport.ParseReference() or equivalent API creating the reference object.
// That's also why the various identification/formatting methods of this type do not support returning errors.

// WARNING: While this design freezes the content of the reference within this process, it can not freeze the outside
// world: paths may be replaced by symlinks elsewhere, HTTP APIs may start returning different results, and so on.
