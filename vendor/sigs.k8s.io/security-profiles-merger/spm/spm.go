// Package spm holds the few declarations the seccomp, apparmor and landlock
// packages have in common, so that each names them once rather than three
// times:
//
//   - SliceDiff, the one diff shape all three produce.
//     seccomp.SliceDiff, landlock.RightsDiff and apparmor.StringSliceDiff
//     are alias declarations of it, so a value of one is a value of the
//     others.
//   - InputError and the sentinel errors below, which each package
//     re-exports, so that errors.Is against a sentinel here matches an
//     error any of the three returned.
//   - MaxPathLen, the path length limit of apparmor and landlock.
//   - Diff, the one method the three diff results share.
//
// Nothing needs to import this package: each profile package re-exports
// what it uses under its own name. Import it to match a sentinel without
// picking one of the three packages arbitrarily, or to hold a diff whose
// profile type was decided elsewhere.
//
// It is deliberately small. The three profile types have no common shape,
// and no operation over "a profile" can say anything before it knows which
// of the three it has, so anything beyond this belongs in the package that
// knows the type. The spm command, whose name this package shares, is the
// worked example: it dispatches over a table of per-type function values.
