// When inputs share an action, DefaultErrnoRet and per-syscall ErrnoRet
// come from the earliest of them (see Errno values). ListenerPath,

// the result depends on the native architecture of the running program, so
// run Intersect on the node that loads its result (see Architectures).

// SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG if any does (see Flags). A single profile is
// normalized (see Single profiles).
//
// Entries sharing an action, errno and argument filters are grouped into
