// On the architectures in multiplexingArchitectures, a process reaches the
// socket and SysV IPC syscalls not only directly but also through one
// multiplexer, socketcall(2) or ipc(2), whose first argument names the
// syscall. libseccomp follows that: a rule for such a syscall is added as
// written for the direct syscall and a second time for the multiplexer,
// where the condition on the first argument is replaced by one matching the
// sub-call number and every other condition is kept on the same argument
// index, although the multiplexer passes the arguments of the call
// elsewhere. socket ALLOW if a0 == 2 therefore becomes socketcall ALLOW if
// a0 == 1, which allows every socket(2) made through socketcall.
//
// The rules of one syscall thus decide two paths. Under the sub-call test,
// libseccomp builds the multiplexed rules into a tree as it builds the rules
// of a syscall, so rules that test no first argument decide the multiplexer
// path of their sub-call as they decide the direct path. Rules that test it
// can end up with the same filter there, or with one that is a prefix of
// another's: with different results, libseccomp then refuses the rule with
// EEXIST or drops one of them, depending on the order they are added in,
// unless the multiplexer has an unconditional rule of its own added first,
// which then decides every call of the multiplexer and hides the
// multiplexed rules. Checked against libseccomp 2.6.1.
//
// The merge therefore reads the multiplexer path of each of these syscalls
// separately (see multiplexInput.view) and settles a result whose
// multiplexer path would be refused, or would permit more (intersection) or
// less (union) than an input's (see settleMultiplexed).
