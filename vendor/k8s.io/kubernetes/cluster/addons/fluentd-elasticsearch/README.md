# Logging Agent For Elasticsearch
==============

Logging Agent For Elasticsearch is a DaemonSet which spawns a pod on each node
that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers
and sends them to Elasticsearch, deployed in the cluster. Later logs can be
accessed either by querying Elasticsearch directly or by using Kibana.
