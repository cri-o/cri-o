# Kubernetes Examples: releases.k8s.io/HEAD

This directory contains a number of examples of how to run
real applications with Kubernetes.

Demonstrations of how to use specific Kubernetes features can be found in our [documents](../docs/).


### Maintained Examples

Maintained Examples are expected to be updated with every Kubernetes
release, to use the latest and greatest features, current guidelines
and best practices, and to refresh command syntax, output, changed
prerequisites, as needed.
