# CRI-O Metrics

To enable the [Prometheus][0] metrics exporter for CRI-O, either start `crio`
with `--metrics-enable` or add the corresponding option to a config overwrite,
for example `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-metrics.conf`:

```toml
[crio.metrics]
enable_metrics = true
```

The metrics endpoint serves per default on port `9090`. This can be changed via
the `--metrics-port` command line argument or via the configuration file:

```toml
metrics_port = 9090
```

If CRI-O runs with enabled metrics, then this can be verified by querying the
endpoint manually via [curl][1].

```bash
> curl localhost:9090/metrics
â€¦
```

## Available Metrics

Beside the [default golang based metrics][2], CRI-O provides the following additional metrics:

| Metric Key                             | Possible Labels                                                                                                                         | Type    | Purpose                                                                  |

- Available CRI-O RPC's from the [gRPC API][3]: `Attach`, `ContainerStats`, `ContainerStatus`,
  `CreateContainer`, `Exec`, `ExecSync`, `ImageFsInfo`, `ImageStatus`,
  `ListContainerStats`, `ListContainers`, `ListImages`, `ListPodSandbox`,
  `PodSandboxStatus`, `PortForward`, `PullImage`, `RemoveContainer`,
  `RemoveImage`, `RemovePodSandbox`, `ReopenContainerLog`, `RunPodSandbox`,
  `StartContainer`, `Status`, `StopContainer`, `StopPodSandbox`,
  `UpdateContainerResources`, `UpdateRuntimeConfig`, `Version`

- Available error categories for `crio_image_pulls_failures`:
  - `UNKNOWN`: The default label which gets applied if the error is not known
  - `CONNECTION_REFUSED`: The local network is down or the registry refused the
    connection.
  - `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: The connection timed out during the image download.
  - `NOT_FOUND`: The registry does not exist at the specified resource
  - `BLOB_UNKNOWN`: This error may be returned when a blob is unknown to the
    registry in a specified repository. This can be returned with a standard get
    or if a manifest references an unknown layer during upload.
  - `BLOB_UPLOAD_INVALID`: The blob upload encountered an error and can no
    longer proceed.
  - `BLOB_UPLOAD_UNKNOWN`: If a blob upload has been cancelled or was never
    started, this error code may be returned.
  - `DENIED`: The access controller denied access for the operation on a
    resource.
  - `DIGEST_INVALID`: When a blob is uploaded, the registry will check that the
    content matches the digest provided by the client. The error may include a
    detail structure with the key "digest", including the invalid digest string.
    This error may also be returned when a manifest includes an invalid layer
    digest.
  - `MANIFEST_BLOB_UNKNOWN`: This error may be returned when a manifest blob is
    unknown to the registry.
  - `MANIFEST_INVALID`: During upload, manifests undergo several checks ensuring
    validity. If those checks fail, this error may be returned, unless a more
    specific error is included. The detail will contain information the failed
    validation.
  - `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN`: This error is returned when the manifest, identified by
    name and tag is unknown to the repository.
  - `MANIFEST_UNVERIFIED`: During manifest upload, if the manifest fails
    signature verification, this error will be returned.
  - `NAME_INVALID`: Invalid repository name encountered either during manifest.
    validation or any API operation.
  - `NAME_UNKNOWN`: This is returned if the name used during an operation is
    unknown to the registry.
  - `SIZE_INVALID`: When a layer is uploaded, the provided size will be checked
    against the uploaded content. If they do not match, this error will be
    returned.
  - `TAG_INVALID`: During a manifest upload, if the tag in the manifest does not
    match the uri tag, this error will be returned.
  - `TOOMANYREQUESTS`: Returned when a client attempts to contact a service too
    many times.
  - `UNAUTHORIZED`: The access controller was unable to authenticate the client.
    Often this will be accompanied by a Www-Authenticate HTTP response header
    indicating how to authenticate.
  - `UNAVAILABLE`: Returned when a service is not available.
  - `UNSUPPORTED`: The operation was unsupported due to a missing implementation
    or invalid set of parameters.

## Exporting Metrics via Prometheus

The CRI-O metrics exporter can be used to provide a cluster wide scraping
endpoint for Prometheus. It is possible to either build the container image
manually via `make metrics-exporter` or directly consume the [available image on
quay.io][4].

[4]: https://quay.io/repository/crio/metrics-exporter

The deployment requires enabled [RBAC][5] within the target Kubernetes
environment and creates a new [ClusterRole][6] to be able to list available
nodes. Beside that a new Role wille be created to be able to update a config-map
within the `cri-o-exporter` namespace. Please be aware that the exporter only
works if the pod has access to the node IP from its namespace. This should
generally work but might be restricted due to network configuration or policies.

[5]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac
[6]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#clusterrole-v1-rbac-authorization-k8s-io

To deploy the metrics exporter within a new `cri-o-metrics-exporter` namespace,
simply apply the [cluster.yaml][7] from the root directory of this repository:

[7]: ../contrib/metrics-exporter/cluster.yaml

```
> kubectl create -f contrib/metrics-exporter/cluster.yaml
```

The `CRIO_METRICS_PORT` environment variable is set per default to `"9090"` and
can be used to customize the metrics port for the nodes. If the deployment is
up and running, it should log the registered nodes as well as that a new
config-map has been created:

```
> kubectl logs -f cri-o-metrics-exporter-65c9b7b867-7qmsb
level=info msg="Getting cluster configuration"
level=info msg="Creating Kubernetes client"
level=info msg="Retrieving nodes"
level=info msg="Registering handler /master (for 172.1.2.0)"
level=info msg="Registering handler /node-0 (for 172.1.3.0)"
level=info msg="Registering handler /node-1 (for 172.1.3.1)"
level=info msg="Registering handler /node-2 (for 172.1.3.2)"
level=info msg="Registering handler /node-3 (for 172.1.3.3)"
level=info msg="Registering handler /node-4 (for 172.1.3.4)"
level=info msg="Updated scrape configs in configMap cri-o-metrics-exporter"
level=info msg="Wrote scrape configs to configMap cri-o-metrics-exporter"
level=info msg="Serving HTTP on :8080"
```

The config-map now contains the [scrape configuration][8], which can be used for
Prometheus:

[8]: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config

```
> kubectl get cm cri-o-metrics-exporter -o yaml
```
